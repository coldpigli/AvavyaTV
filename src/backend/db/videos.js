    description: "I'm sure you've been there or thereabouts in your own way, but there may come a time when you succumb to self-doubt and find it hard to crawl out of that place. What that place does is not let you be; it begins to feed off you and nibble at the qualities that set you apart. I have had that phase subconsciously, consistently linger on for an anxiety-inducing two or more years and while I kept dreaming about the same things that I had grown up wishing for, my motivation to do something about them was damaged, and this realisation would stare me in my face right when it truly mattered.",

With the traditional Nepalese Buddhist hymn forming the base of the song, layered with a traditional Jordanian melody, and bridged seamlessly with composition written by A.R.Rahman, this song truly brings together diverse cultures and musical genres.",

Featuring the gargantuan talent of Piyush Mishra, who has written, composed and sung this track; here's a haunting melody that will stay with you for a long while.",
